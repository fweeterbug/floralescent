        <p class="historyParagraph">
            Founded in 2010 by Josey, Angie, and Evie, Floralescent began as a modest floral shop in Meadowvale. 
            With each passing year, their dedication to exquisite designs and exceptional service earned them a loyal following. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2015, their success led to a move into a larger, more spacious shop on the edge of town. 
            This expansion not only accommodated their growing clientele but also opened doors to new opportunities. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, Floralescent stands as a symbol of community and creativity, inspiring all who step through its doors. 
            Set in Downtown Royse City, Texas, they welcome everyone with open arms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Their competitors such as, fromyouflowers, The Bouqs, & Farmgirl Flowers, will not deter them from their journey and growth.
