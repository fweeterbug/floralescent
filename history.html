        <h1> <strong> Company History </strong> </h1>
        
        <p> 
            Founded in 2010 by Josey, Angie, and Evie, Floralescent began as a modest floral shop in Meadowvale. 
            With each passing year, their dedication to exquisite designs and exceptional service earned them a loyal following. 
            In 2015, their success led to a move into a larger, more spacious shop on the edge of town. 
            This expansion not only accommodated their growing clientele but also opened doors to new opportunities. 
            Today, Floralescent stands as a symbol of community and creativity, inspiring all who step through its doors. 
            Set in Downtown Royse City, Texas, they welcome everyone with open arms.
            Their competitors such as, fromyouflowers, The Bouqs, & Farmgirl Flowers, will not deter them from their journey and growth.
